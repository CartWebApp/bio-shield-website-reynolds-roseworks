<p>AI Tools used in project:</p>
<ul>
<li>ChatGPT, ChatGPT was the main AI used in this project. It was the source of all the HTML code, JS code, and CSS code. It was the benchmark of how our website was created and was a key factor in the development of this site.</li>
<li> Prompts used: (Note, very little actually inputed as most prompts were made at CART where I am not signed into my ChatGPT account.)

make sure it has the nearly 200 lines of code still in there

no i dont want the product page changed, jsut the individual products own pages with the add to cart function

yes

nah, make sure to keep all existing code except for the add to cart stuff, ur getting closer tho

give me the changes to the cart now

no, i want the stuff sent from add to cart to go into the cart page, like appear there

stop the home page stuff, focus on the products thing

what in the products page makes the products link blue and dosent make it go short so i can remove it to be like the other pages

can you just rewrite the whole products page and make it so that button is like thwe same for the otrher pages changed

no, keep everything the same i only want the products button and the other nav links to look just like how they are used in the newly modified pages

no, its really good, can you add the images to checkout?</li>
<li>The only other source of AI that I used in this project was Firefly on Adobe, which was where I created the images for the website</li>
<li>These were the prompts I used for those:</li>
<li>For the Hero image: create a realistic image of the back of a man  (fully clothed), who is in a clearing in the woods. He and everything is blurred except close to the camera a stump is visible with a type of bug spray, make the bug spray mainly orange with a blue border around the bottle with a lady bug covering most of it. The man is looking up at a intimidating mountain barley visible above the treeline, wearing hiking gear. The bottle cover is more bluish  with the cap being black (the piece that sprays and is above the main body)</li>
<li>For the product image that I made: insect repellant bottle photo realistic, make the bottle just a regular bottle but with a cool design with the one paper wrapped around circumference of bottle, make a lotion bottle, with a large container with a push cap then make background slightly tan with small nature elements around it put the product on a blank canvas  remember the bug design on paper wrap and push cap design with beak\</li>
